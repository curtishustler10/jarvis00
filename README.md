# AI Agent - Autonomous Task Execution

An intelligent AI agent that can execute tasks autonomously, maintain memory, and learn from conversations. Built with TypeScript and OpenAI GPT-4.

## Features

ðŸ¤– **Autonomous Agent**: Executes complex tasks by breaking them into steps
ðŸ§  **Memory System**: Automatically stores important information, rules, and learnings
ðŸ“‹ **Task Management**: Creates and tracks tasks with step-by-step execution
ðŸ“œ **Rule Following**: Remembers and follows user-defined rules and preferences
ðŸ’¬ **Chat Interface**: Natural conversation via command line
ðŸ”„ **Persistent Storage**: Data stored locally in simple JSON files

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Run the agent:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## How to Use

Inside the CLI you can use the following commands:

```
/remember <text>   - store a memory note
/rule <text>       - add a rule the agent must follow
/task <goal>       - create a new task with autogenerated steps
/memories          - list stored memories and rules
/tasks             - list current tasks
/exit              - quit the program
```

Anything that isn't a command is sent to the agent as a chat message. The agent will respond using the OpenAI API while taking stored rules and memories into account.

## Development

```bash
# Run the agent in development mode
npm run dev

# Type-check the project
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # Required: Your OpenAI API key
```
