# AI Agent - Autonomous Task Execution

An intelligent AI agent that can execute tasks autonomously, maintain memory, and learn from conversations. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and OpenAI GPT-4.

## Features

ðŸ¤– **Autonomous Agent**: Executes complex tasks by breaking them into steps
ðŸ§  **Memory System**: Automatically stores important information, rules, and learnings
ðŸ“‹ **Task Management**: Creates and tracks tasks with step-by-step execution
ðŸ“œ **Rule Following**: Remembers and follows user-defined rules and preferences
ðŸ’¬ **Chat Interface**: Natural conversation with real-time updates
ðŸ”„ **Persistent Storage**: All data stored locally in browser localStorage

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- **MemoryPanel**: View stored memories and rules
- **TaskPanel**: Monitor active and completed tasks
- **Memory Manager**: Intelligent information storage
- **Task Engine**: Autonomous task execution
- **AI Agent**: OpenAI integration with context awareness
